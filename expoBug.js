This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android SDK version specified in your project and the version actually installed on your system.  The Expo CLI might be trying to use a version of the Android SDK that doesn't exist, is corrupted, or is incompatible with other components. This can manifest as cryptic error messages during the build process, often not clearly indicating the SDK version mismatch. For example, you might see errors relating to build tools, Gradle, or other Android build system components, without a direct mention of SDK version conflict.
